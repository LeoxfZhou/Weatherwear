# WeatherWear: A Personal Clothing Assistant

## What and Why?

WeatherWear is a mobile web application designed to solve the daily challenge of choosing clothing before going out. The app selects clothes based on weather conditions and personal schedules. 

Many people struggle with:
- Underdressing or overdressing for the day
- Time-consuming process of checking weather and planning outfits

Our app addresses these issues by providing several clothing suggestions that consider multiple factors rather than simple temperature, ensuring users are comfortable and prepared for their entire day.

## For Whom?

The primary target users are: anyone who is frustrated about choosing clothes.

These users typically:
- Have busy, dynamic schedules
- May not have easy access to windows or balconies
- Want to look appropriate and feel comfortable

## How?

WeatherWear provides a comprehensive clothing recommendation system with the following key features:

### Weather Data
- Real-time weather data retrieval
- Detailed information including:
  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Wind speed
  * Precipitation probability
  * UV index

### Personalized Schedule Planning
Users can input their daily schedule and specify:
- Duration of outdoor exposure (outdoor or indoor)
- Time of outdoor activities (e.g., 11:00 am-3:00 pm)
- Specific locations (optional)

### Wardrobe Management
- Digital wardrobe inventory (users input photos)
- Add/remove clothes
- Favorite types of clothes tracking

### Intelligent Clothing Recommendations

Two recommendation modes based on aesthetic preferences:

1. Classical Mode:
   - Suggest several solutions including:
     * Base layers
     * Mid-layers
     * Outer layers
     * Accessories (scarves, gloves, hats)
   - Recommendations based on weather, personal schedule, and favorite types of clothes

2. Match Mode:
   - Customers can scroll through their wardrobe to choose their favorite match
   - Provide suggestions even without complete data input (with general clothing types, not specific items)

### Notification System
- Layer change recommendations
- Weather change warnings

### Additional Features
- Option to save favorite outfits
- Share outfit combinations
- Color and style coordination suggestions
- Machine learning to improve recommendations over time (optional)

- Involves multiple technical challenges:
  * Weather API integration
  * User interface design
  * Backend data management

### Challenges to Solve
- Weather prediction
